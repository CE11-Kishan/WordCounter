    <meta name="description" content=" Online word counters are a perfect tool for anyone who needs to keep a count of their words and characters, but doesn’t use Microsoft Word. Imagine writing a piece and having to manually count the words! Not only will it take forever, but there’s a chance you won’t be wholly accurate. This tool is also a good way to assess your words per minute typing rate. Simply time yourself timing for five minutes. Type into the box on the online word counter. When the time is up, divide your total word count by five, and you have your average words per minute rate.And also undrline the grammitacally wrong words and sentences by red colour.

                                should be a

                                effectively.

                <p> As a student, you will often be expected to write assignments with specific word counts. Although a
                    bit
                    of leeway is usually given, if you are well off the count either way, you could lose marks. What a
                    waste of you time and effort! As a lecturer, you can use this tool to ensure your students’
                    assignments
                    are the correct length.</p>
